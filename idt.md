## Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) 
The Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) is a data structure in the x86 architecture that holds information about various interrupt handlers. 
The x86 architecture, commonly used in personal computers, uses the IDT to manage and respond to hardware and software interrupts.

Here are the key points about the Interrupt Descriptor Table:

1. **Purpose:** The IDT is used to map interrupt numbers to their corresponding interrupt service routines (ISRs). An interrupt number is a unique identifier associated with a specific type of interrupt, such as a hardware interrupt (e.g., timer interrupt, keyboard interrupt) or a software interrupt (e.g., system call).

2. **Structure:** The IDT is an array of data structures called interrupt descriptors. Each interrupt descriptor contains information about a particular interrupt handler, including the memory address where the handler code is located and other attributes.

3. **Size:** The size of the IDT can vary, but it is typically limited to 256 entries in 32-bit systems (0 to 255), as there are 256 possible interrupt numbers in the x86 architecture.

4. **Interrupt Gate and Trap Gate:** Each entry in the IDT can be either an Interrupt Gate or a Trap Gate. The main difference between the two is how they handle hardware interrupts versus software interrupts. Interrupt Gates are typically used for hardware interrupts, and they disable further interrupts during their execution. Trap Gates, on the other hand, allow for nested interrupts, allowing other interrupts to occur while the handler is being executed.

5. **Setting up the IDT:** During system initialization, an operating system or a kernel sets up the IDT by populating its entries with the appropriate information. This involves specifying the base addresses of the interrupt service routines and configuring other attributes.

6. **Loading the IDT:** Once set up, the IDT is loaded by writing the address of the IDT structure to a special register, the Interrupt Descriptor Table Register (IDTR). This register informs the CPU about the location and size of the IDT.

7. **Handling Interrupts:** When an interrupt occurs, the CPU uses the interrupt number to index into the IDT and find the corresponding interrupt descriptor. It then jumps to the memory address specified in the descriptor, executing the associated interrupt service routine.

In summary, the Interrupt Descriptor Table is a crucial part of interrupt handling in the x86 architecture, providing a mapping between interrupt numbers and the routines that handle those interrupts. It allows the CPU to efficiently respond to various events and transitions between different modes of operation.

## IDT entries

Yes, each entry in the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) contains information about the location and attributes of the related interrupt handler function.
The interrupt handler function, often referred to as the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), is the code that gets executed when a specific interrupt occurs.

The key information stored in each IDT entry includes:

1. **Offset:** The offset is the memory address where the ISR code is located. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU jumps to this address to start executing the handler code.

2. **Segment Selector:** The segment selector specifies the code segment in which the ISR resides. This information is used by the CPU to locate the correct code segment before jumping to the offset address.

3. **Type and Attributes:** The type and attributes fields in the IDT entry specify the type of interrupt gate (e.g., Interrupt Gate or Trap Gate) and other attributes associated with the interrupt.

Here is a simplified representation of an IDT entry:

```plaintext
| Offset (32 bits) | Segment Selector (16 bits) | Type and Attributes (16 bits) |
```

When an interrupt occurs, the CPU uses the interrupt number to index into the IDT. 
It then retrieves the relevant IDT entry, extracts the offset and segment selector, and jumps to the specified memory location to execute the ISR.

The operating system or kernel is responsible for populating the IDT during system initialization. It sets up the IDT with the appropriate ISR addresses and configuration for handling various interrupts, both hardware and software.

In summary, each entry in the IDT serves as a mapping between an interrupt number and the corresponding ISR, providing the necessary information for the CPU to handle interrupts by jumping to the correct code location.


## An Interrupt Vector Table (IVT) 

An Interrupt Vector Table (IVT) is a data structure used in computer systems to manage and handle interrupts. 
An interrupt is a mechanism by which a hardware or software component can request the attention of the CPU to handle a specific event or condition. These events could include hardware interrupts (e.g., input/output operations, timer events) or software interrupts (e.g., system calls, exceptions).

The Interrupt Vector Table contains a set of memory addresses, known as vectors, corresponding to different interrupt service routines (ISRs). Each vector points to the starting address of the code that should be executed when a particular interrupt occurs. When an interrupt is triggered, the CPU looks up the corresponding vector in the Interrupt Vector Table to find the address of the appropriate ISR.

The structure of the Interrupt Vector Table may vary depending on the computer architecture and operating system. In some systems, the IVT is part of the system's memory, and its entries are populated during the system's initialization. In others, it may be dynamically modified during runtime.

For example, in x86-based systems, the Interrupt Vector Table is often located at the beginning of memory (at address 0x0000:0000) and contains entries for various interrupts, including both hardware and software interrupts. Each entry in the table is typically 4 bytes and contains the 32-bit address of the ISR.

In summary, the Interrupt Vector Table is a crucial component in managing interrupts in a computer system, providing a mapping between interrupt numbers and the corresponding interrupt service routines.
