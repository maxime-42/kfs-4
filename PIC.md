In the context of x86 assembly language and interrupt handling, the value `0x20` is often used as the interrupt vector offset for the Master Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC).
This means that the interrupts generated by devices connected to the Master PIC will be mapped to interrupt vectors starting from `0x20` (32 in decimal).<br/>

For example, if an interrupt is generated on IRQ 0 (the first interrupt line connected to the Master PIC), the corresponding interrupt vector will be `0x20`.
If the interrupt is on IRQ 1, the vector will be `0x21`, and so on. This mapping allows the system to identify the appropriate interrupt service routine (ISR) to execute when an interrupt occurs.
