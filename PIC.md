## what is `0X20`
In the context of x86 assembly language and interrupt handling, the value `0x20` is often used as the interrupt vector offset for the Master Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC).
This means that the interrupts generated by devices connected to the Master PIC will be mapped to interrupt vectors starting from `0x20` (32 in decimal).<br/>

For example, if an interrupt is generated on IRQ 0 (the first interrupt line connected to the Master PIC), the corresponding interrupt vector will be `0x20`.
If the interrupt is on IRQ 1, the vector will be `0x21`, and so on. This mapping allows the system to identify the appropriate interrupt service routine (ISR) to execute when an interrupt occurs.


## Dual PIC

"Dual PIC" typically refers to the use of two Programmable Interrupt Controllers (PICs) in a system. The most common scenario where you encounter the term "dual PIC" is in legacy computer systems, especially those based on the x86 architecture.

In early IBM PC-compatible systems, a single 8259 PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) was used to manage and prioritize interrupt requests (IRQs) from various hardware devices. However, this single PIC had limitations, particularly when it came to handling a large number of devices or in systems with multiple processors.

To address these limitations, a technique called "cascading" or "dual PIC" configuration was introduced. In this configuration:

1. **Master PIC:** The original 8259 PIC was designated as the "master" PIC. It continued to handle lower-priority interrupts (IRQs 0 to 7).

2. **Slave PIC:** Another 8259 PIC was added and configured as the "slave" PIC. This slave PIC was connected to one of the IRQ lines of the master PIC, effectively extending the number of available IRQ lines to handle more devices.

3. **Cascade Configuration:** IRQ 2 of the master PIC was used to connect to the INTR line of the slave PIC. This configuration allowed the master PIC to recognize interrupts from the slave PIC, effectively cascading the two controllers.

4. **Expanded IRQs:** With this dual PIC configuration, the system could handle IRQs from both the master and slave PICs, resulting in support for a total of 15 IRQ lines (IRQs 0 to 15).

This dual PIC configuration was a solution to the limitations of the original single PIC in handling a larger number of devices and IRQs. However, it was still a somewhat complex arrangement and had its own set of challenges.

It's important to note that modern computer systems have moved away from the use of traditional PICs, and instead, they often use more advanced interrupt controllers like the Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC). APIC provides enhanced features and scalability, especially in multiprocessor systems, without the need for cascading multiple controllers.
